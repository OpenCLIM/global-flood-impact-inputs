  summary: >
    This model takes all of the parameter/ input data from the user specifically for the urban flooding workflow. 
    This data is then propogated through the model, reducing user input. 
  source_code: https://github.com/OpenCLIM/flood-impact-inputs
  description: >
    All data/ choices made by the user are inputted at this stage of the model to reduce user error. 
    This process simplifies the user input methods.
