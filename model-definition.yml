  summary: >
    This model takes all of the parameter/ input data from the user specifically for the urban flooding workflow. 
    This data is then propogated through the model, reducing user input.

  description: >
    All data/ choices made by the user are inputted at this stage of the model to reduce user error. 
    This process simplifies the user input methods.

        description:
          # If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period" then the rainfall depth corresponding to the `DURATION` and `RETURN_PERIOD` are extracted from the relevant CSV file in the `future-drainage` dataslot.
          # If the `TIME_HORIZON` is anything other than "baseline", the rainfall depth is then uplifted by the percentage given in the CSV file.
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "total_depth" then the `TOTAL_DEPTH` parameter is used to define the amount of rainfall and the `RETURN_PERIOD` and `TIME_HORIZON` parameters are ignored.
          # The rainfall depth value, either directly provided or extracted from FUTURE-DRAINAGE, is used to generate a storm profile in combination with the summer profile and `DURATION` parameter.

        description:
          The duration of the rainfall event.
          This value is used in combination with the rainfall depth and summer profile to generate a storm profile.
          #If `RAINFALL_MODE` is "return_period", this value is also used to extract a rainfall depth from FUTURE-DRAINAGE.

        description:
          If `PERMEABLE_AREAS` is set to "polygons", polygons from the `green_areas` dataslot are used to define areas which are permeable.
